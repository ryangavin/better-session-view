# Controlled mixer face

`src/mixer/MixerView.tsx` is the reusable four-deck presentation. Import it through
`@openflow/widgets/mixer/MixerView.tsx`; `model.ts` defines its host contract. It composes
existing controls and waveforms, and imports no app, protocol, core or playback code.

## Ownership

The host supplies `state`, `commands`, `readFrame`, `theme` and `params`. The component
has no authoritative musical state. It never advances playback, applies quantization,
chooses the first section on a source change, computes gain, or clears clips on Stop.
It renders supplied selections and pending states, and emits intent using stable IDs.
The host can acknowledge immediately, queue, reject, or report loading without the
component inventing a successful result.

- `MixerState` contains deck metadata, available stems, sections, selected/queued IDs,
  control values, transport labels, loop bounds, effects and their IDs. Deck status is
  empty/loading/ready/unavailable. Non-ready launcher fieldsets are disabled, and missing
  stems disable their individual launch/stop/level controls. The host supplies four deck
  positions, four stem positions per deck, and three EQ values; unavailable stems retain
  a placeholder position. Section counts and names can vary between decks.
- `MixerCommands` contains semantic operations, not React setters. `launch(deckId,
  sectionId, stemId?)` uses null for stop and omitted stem for the entire deck. Source
  changes send only `setDeck(id, 'full', value)`; all initialization policy belongs to
  the controller. An effect is selected by ID, even though Select displays an index.
- A selected section is an ID or null. A queued value is undefined for no pending
  change, null for a queued stop, or a section ID for a queued launch. These distinctions
  must survive the adapter; do not collapse null and undefined with `??` there.
- `MixerParams` supplies ranges, units, defaults and tapers. The host maps widget values
  to its engine units; the preview's 0–100 levels and synthetic gain law are not an
  engine specification. EQ fills explicitly originate at zero.
- `MixerTheme` supplies resolved CSS colors keyed by stem/deck IDs, plus primary and
  signal colors. Tokens are scoped to the mixer root. The component never writes to
  body, storage, or another window's palette.

## Frame readings

`readFrame()` is a stable, synchronous, read-only sampler. It returns absolute beat
positions and normalized measured output levels keyed by deck ID, plus the master
level. A real adapter should read the engine/audio clock and cached metering; calling
it must not schedule or advance playback. The bench hook supplies invented readings.

`FramePlayhead` samples each deck's position on animation frames and updates its own
DOM marker. `FrameMeter` samples a level and applies presentation-only 35ms attack /
140ms release smoothing. These small children own their animation updates; the launcher
and all controls do not rerender at frame rate. All frame loops cancel on unmount.
The renderer can pause, miss frames or move to the background without becoming a clock
source. Hosts should keep their readers cheap because several displayed instruments
sample each frame.

The current overview is a shared 32-bar window in 4/4, following the state's whole beat.
Hosts provide waveforms normalized to that displayed window, and per-deck absolute beat
positions in the same coordinate system. General timeline zoom/meter changes require an
explicit extension to the display model rather than engine policy in the view.

## Bench adapter

`bench/usePreviewMixer.ts` owns fictional tracks, peaks, the frame-integrated preview
clock, queues, loop behavior, source changes, crossfade/gain calculations, and synthetic
meter levels. It adapts its private array positions into public IDs. Its stable reader
uses a ref to the latest simulated state. `bench/PlayCase.tsx` mounts the hook and passes
its result to the same `MixerView` that a real app will use.

`bench/PlayTheme.tsx` remains an experiment tool. It resolves theme roles and deck
variations in the wrapper; the reusable face knows nothing about presets or randomization.
Only the bench CSS positions the floating theme editor or hides workspace descriptions.
`src/mixer/mixer.css` contains the consolidated instrument layout, without bench selectors.

## Integrating mix

A future mix-owned `useMixerViewModel` can adapt its playback controller to this contract.
It must own track loading, beat/time conversion, queue acknowledgements, source policy,
and measurement. Do not mount several copies of the current single-track useMix hook as
an implicit four-deck engine: audio context, shared master/FX, launch scheduling and
lifecycle ownership need their own deliberate controller design.

This extraction does not add audio capabilities, change mix's engine, or add a Play
route to mix. The bench remains the integration proof and fast visual feedback loop.

## Verification

`MixerView.test.ts` checks stable-ID commands, host-authoritative selection updates,
source/stop delegation, unavailable state and frame sampling with no playback commands.
`preview.test.ts` checks the fixture adapter's queued launches, pause/immediate behavior,
source initialization, loop wrapping and Stop reset. Browser checks verify layout and
real widget interactions; `npm test -- --project=widgets` runs both with the widget suite.
