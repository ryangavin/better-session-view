/**
 * Every device face the app draws, with no Live behind them.
 *
 * The widget bench proves the parts; this proves the arrangements. They can't
 * be one page: a face is composed in `ui/` out of `widgets/`, and the widget
 * bench may import `widgets/src` and nothing else — which is the rule that
 * keeps that module from learning what an EQ Eight is.
 *
 * Nothing here needs a bridge, a socket or a set: a face reads a `ChainDevice`
 * and a list of parameters, and [`fixtures.ts`](./fixtures.ts) is a device that
 * answers like Live without being it. That is what makes this page worth
 * having — a face can be looked at in every state, including the ones that are
 * a nuisance to reach in a real set, and the app can't show any of them until
 * a track happens to have that device on it.
