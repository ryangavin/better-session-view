/**
 * Drag scenes somewhere else in the set. One gesture, two grips.
 *
 * A song header grabs the whole run under it; a scene's own number grabs that
 * scene, or the whole selection when it's part of one. Both end up here as a
 * list of scene indexes, because that's all `planSceneMove` has ever wanted —
 * it takes any set, contiguous or not, and a destination gap.
 *
 * **A header drag moves one block, not one song.** A song is a label rather
 * than a range, so it can appear in several runs, and each run has its own
 * header — dragging the header for "part 2 of 2" has to move the part you
 * grabbed. Gathering both runs is a thing `planSceneMove` supports and a thing
 * you can do by dragging one next to the other; doing it as a silent side
 * effect of grabbing one header would move sixty scenes nobody pointed at.
 *
 * This is the only gesture in the app that can destroy work — see
 * core/src/sceneMove.ts. Everything the grid does otherwise is either a view
 * change or a write our own undo reverses.
