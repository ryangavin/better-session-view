// and the real widths live in the .als, which this project never parses. So
// they're ours to choose.
//
// One setting drives every track column rather than per-column dragging. The
// pixel presets are predictable; the viewport layouts divide the available
// grid width among either all rendered tracks, one 8-track hardware bank, or
// two banks. It moves the track columns only — the scene name is the row's
// label, and a setting about how many tracks fit shouldn't cost you the thing
// you read the rows by.

 * and what the song headers align their own facts against.
 *
 * **Sized by its rows and nothing else**: 10px of lead, a 26px number, a 26px
 * bpm and a 28px key, plus 8px at the tail, is 98px. The rest is air before the
 * Master column.
 *
 * It was half as wide again while it had its own heading to fit — a label and
 * three buttons need 158px, and a column whose header doesn't fit is a column
 * lying about its width. The heading spans this column and Master together now,
 * which is what let this shrink to what a row actually needs.
