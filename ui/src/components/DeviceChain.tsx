/**
 * The selected track's device chain, along the bottom of the window.
 *
 * This is the first thing in the app drawn out of [`widgets/`](../../../widgets/README.md)
 * rather than its own components, and the boundary holds the way the mixer's
 * faders proved it could: `widgets/` takes a name and two booleans, and knows
 * nothing about `BSV`, the bridge, or Live. The adapting is all here and in
 * [`devices/`](./devices/), which is where a device's controls become widgets.
 *
 * **Faces, not just shells.** A device the app has drawn a face for renders it;
 * everything else gets `Faceplate`, which lays out whatever controls the device
 * reports. Both only when the device is open — a folded one is a title bar with
 * nothing behind it, and nothing behind it is being watched either.
 *
 * **The fold triangle is the subscription.** `open` in the chain watch is
 * derived from fold state, so unfolding a device here is what makes the bridge
 * read and observe its ~40 parameters, and folding it is what drops them. That
 * is the whole economy of the parameter tier expressed as one triangle, and it
 * is why this component writes fold rather than keeping it locally: a fold that
 * didn't reach Live would be a fold that changed nothing about the cost.
