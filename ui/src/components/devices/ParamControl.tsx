/**
 * One Live control, bound to one widget. The seam every faceplate goes through.
 *
 * A face's job is arrangement: which control sits where, and what it's called.
 * Everything *else* about wiring a control to Live is the same wherever it is
 * drawn — read the range out of the parameter, hold the dragged value until the
 * readback agrees, prefer Live's own spelling over any formatter, refuse the
 * gesture when Live says the parameter can't move — so it is here rather than
 * in each face. See [device faces](../../../docs/device-faces.md).
 *
 * **A slot may find nothing, and that has to show.** A face matches its
 * controls against parameter *names*, and Live's names are Live's — a device
 * that spells one differently, or a Live version that renames one, leaves a
 * slot with no parameter behind it. Every control here accepts `null` and draws
 * itself plainly dead rather than disappearing, because a face that quietly
 * drops the control it couldn't find is a face that looks correct and isn't.
