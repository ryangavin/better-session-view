/**
 * The container Live draws around a plug-in it cannot draw itself.
 *
 * A VST or AU has its own window and Live has no way inside it, so what sits in
 * the chain is a shell holding two things: an X-Y control, and the two choosers
 * naming which of the plug-in's parameters that control moves. It is the whole
 * device, which makes it the plainest possible caller of
 * [`XYPad`](../../../../../widgets/src/controls/XYPad.tsx) — a plane with
 * nothing drawn behind it — and the reason it exists here is to be exactly that.
 *
 * **It is not in [the registry](../faces.ts), on purpose.** Two things would
 * have to be true first. A plug-in's `class_name` is almost certainly
 * `PluginDevice`, but `bridge/LOM.md` has no section for that class and nothing
 * here has read one off a real set — and registering a guess would put this
 * face in front of every plug-in in a chain, replacing `Faceplate`, which draws
 * *all* of a plug-in's controls and is the better answer until the rest is
 * true. If it confirms, this folder becomes `plugindevice/` to match the rule.
 *
 * **Which parameters the axes drive is ours, not Live's.** Live keeps that
 * assignment in the container and the protocol carries a device's parameters
 * rather than the container's own state, so these choosers pick out of the
 * plug-in's parameter list and hold the choice locally. Moving the plane does
 * move Live — those are real parameters and `onParam` is the real write. What
 * won't round-trip is the *choice*, which is why it starts at `none` rather
 * than pretending to restore what Live has.
 *
 * **An unassigned axis still moves, and that isn't the dead-slot rule being
 * broken.** A control drawn dead means a slot that expected a parameter and
 * found none — the face is wrong and has to show it. This is the other thing:
 * the axis has no target *because nobody has picked one*, which the chooser an
 * inch below says outright. Live's own container moves the same way, and a
 * plane that refused to until it was told where to point would read as broken
 * rather than as unassigned. The position it holds is its own until an
 * assignment arrives, and then the parameter's value is what it draws.
 *
 * The write goes straight out rather than through
 * [`ParamControl`](../ParamControl.tsx), so it has no local hold while the
 * readback catches up. Every other bound control in the app does have one, and
 * the fix is a `ParamPad` next to the rest of that file rather than anything
 * here.
