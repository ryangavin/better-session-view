/**
 * Which of the EQ Eight's parameters is which.
 *
 * A face draws band 4's frequency knob in a fixed place; Live hands over a flat
 * list of controls. Something has to join the two, and the only join available
 * is the parameter's **name** — there is no id, and its position in the list is
 * a fact about one Live version rather than about the device.
 *
 * **Matched loosely, on purpose.** Live's own names have not been read off a
 * real device in this project — see the unverified note in
 * [device faces](../../../../docs/device-faces.md) — and an exact table would
 * turn one renamed control into forty dead ones. So a band's controls are found
 * by band number plus a keyword, and a slot that matches nothing comes back
 * null and is drawn plainly dead rather than dropped. Every assumption this
 * file makes is therefore visible on the face itself.
 *
 * **The A channel wins.** In L/R and M/S modes an EQ Eight has two sets of
 * bands, `… A` and `… B`, and this takes whichever comes first — which is A, in
 * Live's ordering. Drawing B needs `Eq8Device.edit_mode`, a device *property*
 * rather than a parameter, and nothing on the wire carries one yet.
