// Which edge of a row a scene drag's drop indicator belongs on.
//
// **One gap, one line.** A gap in scene numbering is addressable from both
// sides — song A ending at 5 and song B starting at 6 are both "gap 6" — so the
// two answers here have to be written against each other rather than each
// drawing its own. They resolve toward *above*, and `below` renders only where
// nothing above can express the gap.
//
// They live here rather than beside the rows they belong to because both are
// pure functions, and a module that exports anything besides components cannot
// be hot-replaced: React Fast Refresh gives up on the whole file and reloads
// the page. `Row.tsx` and `SongHeaderRow.tsx` are the two files this refactor
// touches most, so they get to keep their reload-free edit loop.
